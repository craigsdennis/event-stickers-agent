Okay so each page has this /events/EVENT_SLUG style. I'd like to create a
/event/EVENT_SLUG/phone page that people can get to by adding a QR code on
the /events/EVENT_SLUG page. That new page does useAgent to connect to the
same agent and does a call to take a photo using their forward facing
webcam. They send the photoDataURI of their photo to the Hackathon agent by
calling the addAttendeePhoto method.
